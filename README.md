👁️ Nexus Neural Link: Pro-MaxNexus Neural Link is a high-fidelity, biometric interface that replicates the advanced accessibility features of iOS 18 for desktop environments. By combining real-time iris mesh tracking with a voice-activated command layer, it creates a seamless, hands-free bridge between human intention and digital execution.🚀 The VisionInspired by the "Snap-to-Item" and "Dwell Control" logic found in modern neural interfaces, this project aims to provide $100\%$ cursor accuracy using standard consumer-grade webcams. It is designed for developers, accessibility advocates, and tech enthusiasts looking to explore the future of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).✨ Cutting-Edge Features1. Neural Lock CalibrationA custom 5-point calibration engine that maps the micro-movements of your pupils to your specific monitor resolution.Precision Mapping: Automatically calculates the min/max biometric range of your eyes.Adaptive Scaling: Ensures $100\%$ corner-to-corner screen reach without neck strain.2. Stability & Smoothing EngineEliminates the "shaking" common in webcam trackers using an 8-frame Moving Average Filter and Nose-Bridge Anchoring.Relative Anchor: Landmarks are measured against the Nose Bridge (Landmark 168) to ignore head-tilt jitters.Deadzone Logic: Prevents cursor vibration during static gaze.3. Multimodal Input LayerTotal control via biological and vocal cues:Dwell Control: Stare-to-Select logic (1.3s hold triggers a click).Voice Command Thread: Real-time speech recognition for Right Click, Scroll Up, and Scroll Down.Biometric Blinking: Intentional blink detection for rapid selection.🛠️ Installation & SetupPrerequisitesPython 3.9+A standard 720p/1080p WebcamActive Microphone for Voice CommandsCommand Line InstallBash# Clone the repository

🕹️ User ManualLaunch: Run python nexus_main.py.Calibrate: Follow the cyan dot to all 5 positions on your screen. Look with your eyes only—keep your head still.Navigate: Once "Neural Link Active" appears, your gaze controls the cursor.Action: * Click: Blink firmly or stare for 1.3 seconds.Voice: Say "Scroll Down" or "Right Click" for extended functions.🧠 Technical ArchitectureThe core logic utilizes MediaPipe's Iris Mesh to isolate landmarks 468 (Left Pupil) and 473 (Right Pupil). These 3D coordinates are processed through a linear interpolation layer to transform tiny ocular movements into high-resolution screen coordinates.🤝 ContributingWe welcome contributions to improve the Neural Link stability.
